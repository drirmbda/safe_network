### Network

#### Added

- The node exposes more metrics, including its uptime, number of connected peers, number of peers in
  the routing table, and the number of open connections. These will help us more effectively
  diagnose user issues.

#### Changed

- Communication between node and client is strictly limited through synchronised public keys. The
  current beta network allows the node and client to use different public keys, resulting in
  undefined behaviour and performance issues. This change mitigates some of those issues and we also
  expect it to prevent other double spend issues.
- Reduced base traffic for nodes, resulting in better upload performance. This will result in better
  distribution of nanos, meaning users with a smaller number of nodes will be expected to receive
  nanos more often.

#### Fixed

- In the case where a client retries a failed upload, they would re-send their payment. In a rare
  circumstance, the node would forward this reward for a second time too. This is fixed on the node.
- Double spend issue on ARM builds are prevented.
- ARM builds are no longer prevented from connecting to the network.

### Node Manager

#### Added

- Global `--debug` and `--trace` arguments are provided. These will output debugging and trace-level
  logging, respectively, direct to stderr.

#### Changed

- The mechanism used by the node manager to refresh its state is significantly changed to address
  issues that caused commands to hang for long periods of time. Now, when using commands like
  `start`, `stop`, and `reset`, users should no long experience the commands taking an excessive
  amount of time to complete.
- The `nat-detection run` command provides a default list of servers, meaning the `--servers`
  argument is now optional.

### Launchpad

#### Added

- Launchpad and node versions are displayed on the user interface.

#### Changed

- The node manager change for refreshing its state also applies to the launchpad. Users should
  experience improvements in operations that appeared to be hanging but were actually just taking
  an excessive amount of time to complete.

#### Fixed

- The correct primary storage will now be selected on Linux and macOS.
